#Getting Started
[Arturo.io](http://arturo.io) is a build system for digital books.
Books are written in the [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
format and stored on [Github](https://github.com/).  Arturo reads the
`manifest.yml` file that provides most of the configuration and 
customization.
